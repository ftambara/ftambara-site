                <h3>About this project</h3>
                <p>
                    This will be an exploration of ideas in signal processing. Along the way, I will
                    make many mistakes and reinvent the wheel. That is by design. The purpose is to
                    have a fun project as an excuse to investigate concepts which could include
                    linear algebra, assembly, web, fourier transforms, signal processing itself,
                    among others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The initial project will be an application of Nyquist's theorem of minimal
                    sampling rate. To make things easier, I will work with a single channel on a
                    one-dimensional signal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think I lack deep knowledge in most of the areas I'm about to dive in. I hope
                    to look back in a few weeks and observe that to be no longer the case. Let's
                    have fun.

                <h3>Why?</h3>
                <p>
                    While listening to Lex Fridman's podcast episode with members of the Neuralink
                    team, the idea of helping solve some of the most horrendous diseases by the use
                    of technology seemed at reach. In particular, there was one moment when Bliss
                    Chapman gave some fascinating insight into how electrical signals from the
                    brain can be processed locally and compressed down to a small amount of bits to
                    be sent wirelessly. That, among other efficiency challenges, made me want to
                    try my hand at it, even if it's just a poor man's version of it.
                    This is just one way to get started. My ambitious (maybe naive?) goal is to
                    learn enough to be able to contribute in the brain-machine interface field.
