                <h2>Signal Processing</h2>
                <p>
                This will be an exploration of ideas in signal processing. Along the way, I will
                make many mistakes and reinvent the wheel. That is by design. The purpose is to
                have a fun project as an excuse to investigate concepts which could include
                linear algebra, assembly, web, fourier transforms, signal processing itself,
                among others.
                </p>
                <p>
                The initial project will be an application of Nyquist's theorem of minimal
                sampling rate. To make things easier, I will work with a single channel on a
                one-dimensional signal.
                </p>
                <p>
                I think I lack deep knowledge in most of the areas I'm about to dive in. I hope
                to look back in a few weeks and observe that to be no longer the case. Let's
                have fun.
                </p>
                <h3>Why this project?</h3>
                <p>It checks all the boxes!</p>
