    <h1>Federico Tambara</h1>
    <p>
        I am Federico Tambara, a software developer from Argentina.
        This website is a multi-purpose project, with which I intend to 
        accomplish the following goals:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Instead of using a PaaS solution, I want to host my own
                simple website, learning as much as possible in the process
            </li>
            <li>
                Motivate the study of underlying web protocols- TCP, IP, HTTP- 
                and web technologies- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, DNS, CDNs
            </li>
            <li>
                Develop a Go web server
            </li>
            <li>
                Provide a platform for my personal projects
            </li>
            <li>
                Use a bit of vanilla JavaScript
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        This is only the beginning, stay tuned.
    </p>
